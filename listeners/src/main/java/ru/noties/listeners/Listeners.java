/**
 * Simple data structure aimed at storing listeners or observers, that allow adding/removal of
 * elements whilst iterating without copying underlying collection. This comes at a cost: only one single
 * iteration can happen at a time (no nested ones). So, if your listener doesn\'t just listen but also modifies
 * state so another iteration/notification must happen, this collection won\'t do you any good.
 * Anyway for a simple collection of listeners that operate inside one thread this could be a good
 * solution.
 * <p>
 * Please note that as this data structure keeps track of iteration state, methods {@link #begin()} and {@link #end()}
 * must be explicitly called. However if you are planning on iterating on the whole collection calling
 * {@link #end()} is not required. But if you exit iteration early (with a `break` or somehow differently)
 * explicit call to end must take place.
